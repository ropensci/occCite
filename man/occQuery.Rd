\usage{
occQuery(
  x = NULL,
  datasources = c("gbif", "bien"),
  GBIFLogin = NULL,
  GBIFDownloadDirectory = NULL,
  loadLocalGBIFDownload = F,
  checkPreviousGBIFDownload = T,
  options = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{occCiteData}} (the results of
a \code{\link{studyTaxonList}} search) OR a vector with a list of species
names. Note: If the latter, taxonomic rectification uses NCBI
taxonomies. If you want more control than this, use
\code{\link{studyTaxonList}} to create a \code{\link{occCiteData}} object
first.}

\item{datasources}{A vector of occurrence data sources to search. This is
currently limited to GBIF and BIEN, but may expand in the future.}

\item{GBIFLogin}{An object of class \code{\link{GBIFLogin}} to log in to
GBIF to begin the download.}

\item{GBIFDownloadDirectory}{An optional argument that specifies the local
directory where GBIF downloads will be saved. If this is not specified,
the downloads will be saved to your current working directory.}

\item{loadLocalGBIFDownload}{If \code{loadLocalGBIFDownload = T}, then
occCite will load occurrences for the specified species that have been
downloaded by the user and stored in the directory specified by
\code{GBIFDownloadDirectory}.}

\item{checkPreviousGBIFDownload}{If \code{loadLocalGBIFDownload = T},
occCite will check for previously-prepared GBIF downloads on the user's
GBIF account. Setting this option to `TRUE` can significantly speed up
query time if the user has previously queried GBIF for the same taxa.}

\item{options}{A vector of options to pass to \code{\link[rgbif]{occ_download}}.}
}
\value{
The object of class \code{\link{occCiteData}} supplied by the user
as an argument, with occurrence data search results, as well as metadata
on the occurrence sources queried.
}
\description{
Takes rectified list of specimens from
\code{\link{studyTaxonList}} and returns point data from
\code{\link[rgbif]{rgbif}} with metadata.
}
\details{
If you are querying GBIF, note that `occQuery()` only returns
records from GBIF that have coordinates, aren't flagged as having
geospatial issues, and have an occurrence status flagged as "PRESENT".
